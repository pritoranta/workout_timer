# workout_timer
Very simple Android app. Two alternating countdown timers.
The timer values are modifiable by dragging the screen horizontally, while the clock is paused.
The phone's screen never sleeps while the app is active.

Made with Android Studio.
This repository is for the purpose of demoing what has been done by me. It does not include some vital directories and files used in building the app, provided by Android Studio.

Runnable apk: app/build/pr_timer.apk

Source code file: app/src/java/pr/workout_timer/MainActivity.java

App layout file: app/src/res/layout/activity_main.xml

Any other files are not written by me.
